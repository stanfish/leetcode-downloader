<p>
Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.
</p>
The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

<p><b>Example 1: </b><br>
Input:
<pre>
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
</pre>
Output:
<pre>
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2: </b><br>
Input:
<pre>
0 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 1
</pre>
Output:
<pre>
0 0 0
0 1 0
1 2 1
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.</li>
<li>There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.</li>
<li>The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.</li>
</ol>
